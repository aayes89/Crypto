# Crypto
Encrypt and decrypt files in a directory using Java example for educational purposes only.

The base algorithm responds to the behavior of the BlackCat ransomware but with the difference that the IV is placed at the end of the file to facilitate decryption and it is not known if the original does the same.

This code was tested on MacOS using NetBeans IDE with JDK 7
# Features
* encrypt all files in a directory using a known secret key provided within the code
* decrypt all files in a directory using the same secret key provided within the code

# TODO
* improve the algorithm in terms of dynamism and number of lines of code
* allow it to be applied to an entire hard drive or hard drives present on a computer *

# Warning
<b>For educational use only, I am not responsible for any misuse that may be given to it.</b>
